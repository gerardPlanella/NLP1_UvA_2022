But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.)

A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

        "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
        "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
        "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
        "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring. \n",
        "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",

        "\n",
        "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
        "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM? \n",

        "- The page limit is 4 pages excluding references and appendix. This is a strict limit; points will be deducted for longer reports. \n",
        "- There is no strict limit to references and appendix. However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix. \n",

        "- Precise, scientific-sounding, technical, to the point \n",
        "  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat\n",
        "- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much\n",
        "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
        "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
        "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
        "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
        "- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)\n"
